/**
 * @file echo-worker/echo-worker.js
 * @brief Simple NDJSON echo worker for testing stdio Bus kernel
 *
 * This is a minimal reference implementation demonstrating the worker-to-daemon
 * contract for Agent Transport OS (stdio Bus kernel). It serves as both a functional test
 * worker and documentation of the NDJSON communication protocol.
 *
 * ## NDJSON Communication Contract
 *
 * stdio Bus kernel workers communicate with the daemon via stdin/stdout using NDJSON
 * (Newline-Delimited JSON) format:
 *
 * - **Input (stdin)**: The daemon sends JSON-RPC messages, one per line.
 *   Each message is a complete JSON object terminated by a newline (\n).
 *
 * - **Output (stdout)**: The worker writes JSON-RPC responses, one per line.
 *   Each response MUST be a complete JSON object terminated by a newline.
 *   The worker MUST NOT write anything else to stdout (no logs, no debug output).
 *
 * - **Errors (stderr)**: All logging, errors, and debug output MUST go to stderr.
 *   The daemon does not process stderr; it's for operator visibility only.
 *
 * ## Message Types
 *
 * 1. **Requests**: Have both `id` and `method` fields. MUST receive a response
 *    with the same `id`.
 *
 * 2. **Notifications**: Have `method` but no `id`. MUST NOT receive a response.
 *    Workers may optionally send notifications back to the client.
 *
 * 3. **Responses**: Have `id` and either `result` or `error`. Sent by workers
 *    in reply to requests.
 *
 * ## Session Affinity
 *
 * Messages may include a `sessionId` field for session-based routing:
 * - The daemon routes all messages with the same `sessionId` to the same worker
 * - Workers MUST preserve `sessionId` in responses when present in requests
 * - This enables stateful conversations within a session
 *
 * ## Graceful Shutdown
 *
 * Workers MUST handle SIGTERM for graceful shutdown:
 * - Stop accepting new messages
 * - Complete any in-flight processing
 * - Exit with code 0
 *
 * The daemon sends SIGTERM during shutdown or when restarting workers.
 *
 * @example
 * // Start the echo worker
 * node workers-registry/echo-worker/echo-worker.js
 *
 * // Send a request (from another terminal or via stdio Bus kernel)
 * echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"test","params":{"foo":"bar"}}' | node workers-registry/echo-worker/echo-worker.js
 *
 * // Expected response:
 * // {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","result":{"echo":{"foo":"bar"},"method":"test","timestamp":"..."}}
 *
 * @see spec/agent-transport-os.md for the full normative specification
 * @see docs-internal/integration-for-platforms.md for worker implementation guidance

 * 2. Determine message type (request vs notification)
 * 3. Generate appropriate response
 * 4. Preserve sessionId for session affinity
 *
 * @param {string} line - Raw JSON line from stdin (without trailing newline)
 *
 * ## Request Handling
 *
 * For requests (messages with both `id` and `method`):
 * - Generate a response with the same `id`
 * - Include `result` object with echoed data
 * - Preserve `sessionId` if present
 *
 * ## Notification Handling
 *
 * For notifications (messages with `method` but no `id`):
 * - Do NOT send a response (per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec)
 * - Optionally send a notification back if sessionId is present
 *
 * ## Error Handling
 *
 * For malformed JSON:
 * - Log error to stderr (never stdout)
 * - Continue processing subsequent messages
 * - Do NOT crash the worker

 * Proper SIGTERM handling ensures:

 * Workers that don't handle SIGTERM will receive SIGKILL after the
